<h2>Grade 12 Number Patterns â€“ Arithmetic Sequences (Solutions)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Find the 15th term of the arithmetic sequence: 4, 7, 10, 13, ...</strong><br>
    \(a_1 = 4, d = 3\)<br>
    \(a_{15} = a_1 + (15 - 1)d = 4 + 14 \times 3 = 4 + 42 = 46\)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Determine the common difference of the sequence: 5, 11, 17, 23, ...</strong><br>
    \(d = 11 - 5 = 6\)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Find the sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...</strong><br>
    \(a_1 = 2, d = 3, n = 20\)<br>
    Sum \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d) = \frac{20}{2} (4 + 57) = 10 \times 61 = 610\)
  </li>
